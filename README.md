This program provides a set of tools which can be used to extract files from Overwatch, including a GUI for DataTool. DataTool is a tool used to extract data from Overwatch (aka datamining). DataTool is a command prompt based tool so it can be difficult and time-consuming to use for people who are less experienced with command prompt. Because of this, the DataTool GUI in the OW Extract Toolkit provides a graphical user interface which allows you to use the main functionality of DataTool without typing in commands. It's as simple as clicking a button. I did not make DataTool itself, but I did create the GUI.
